# Task 3: Exploration of Other Data Selection and Fine-Tuning Methods

In this task, we explore alternative methods for data selection and investigate several fine-tuning techniques to adapt a pre-trained model for a specific task. The goal is to improve the model performance on our target dataset.

1. Data Selection Strategies
The first step in fine-tuning a model is to carefully select the training data. While the previous tasks focused on influence-based data selection, here we experiment with other selection strategies.

2. Fine-tuning Strategies
In this section, we implemented and compared some parameter-efficient fine-tuning approaches:

    - BitFit
    - LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)
    - iA3 (Implicit Adapter)
