## NNTI Project WS 2024/2025

This Project was done as a part of NNTI (Neural Networks: Theory and Implementation) course in Winter Semester 2024/2025. 
It was divided into three tasks:

- [Task1: Supervised and Unsupervised Fine-tuning of a Chemical Language Model on Lipophilicity](https://github.com/PoojaKHalannavar/Exploration-of-Data-Selection-and-Fine-Tuning-Methods-for-Lipophilicity-Prediction/blob/master/Task1/Task1.md)
- [Task2: Influence Function-based Data Selection](https://github.com/PoojaKHalannavar/Exploration-of-Data-Selection-and-Fine-Tuning-Methods-for-Lipophilicity-Prediction/blob/master/Task2/Task2.md)
- [Task3: Exploration of Other Data Selection and Fine-Tuning Methods](https://github.com/PoojaKHalannavar/Exploration-of-Data-Selection-and-Fine-Tuning-Methods-for-Lipophilicity-Prediction/blob/master/Task3/Task3.md)

### Dataset: 

The dataset used in this project is the Lipophilicity dataset, which is part of the MoleculeNet benchmark.
Lipophilicity, also known as hydrophobicity, is a measure of how readily a substance dissolves in nonpolar solvents (such as oil) compared to polar solvents (such as water).

The dataset contains:

- SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line-Entry System) representations of molecules.
- Corresponding experimentally measured lipophilicity values.
