Dataset: The dataset we are going to use is the Lipophilicity dataset, part of MoleculeNet benchmark.
Lipophilicity, also known as hydrophobicity, is a measure of how readily a substance dissolves in nonpolar solvents (such as oil) compared to polar solvents (such as water).

# Task1: Supervised and Unsupervised Fine-tuning of a Chemical Language Model on Lipophilicity

# Task2: Influence Function-based Data Selection

# Task3: Exploration of Data Selection and Fine-Tuning Methods
